Broadly, we aim to solve novel intriguing problems at the intersection of computer vision and Web mining, by developing scalable machine learning and optimization techniques.
Our research agenda can be better understood by four groups of projects we are actively working on: 
(1) semantic understanding of images and videos,
(2) storytelling with large visual data,
(3) brand and market analysis from social media, and
(4) big machine learning for computer vision.
